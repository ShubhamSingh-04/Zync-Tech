## Steps to Run a React App

### 1. Clone the Repository

If the React project is hosted on a version control system like GitHub, clone it to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```
Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual repository link.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change your working directory to the project folder:
```bash
cd <project-directory>
```
Replace `<project-directory>` with the folder name where the project was cloned.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages for the project:
```bash
npm install
```
Or, if you are using yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

To start the app in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```
Or with yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```

This will launch the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000/` by default.
